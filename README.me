Breaking down a small dataset of credit applications, then developing a 
model using the Decision Tree model found in the scikit-learn Python 
package. At first, some summary statistics are generated to get a grasp of 
the basic features of the dataset. Following that, the data is split into 
the feature matrix and target vector, and then, a 70:30 split is done for 
training and testing. After that, two decision tree models, a balanced and 
unbalanced one are generated, and these two models are then compared.
